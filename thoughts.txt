For my online portfolio I wanted to have it showcase my creative outlets such as my pinterest, instagram, and spotify playlists. Its meant to be a creative extension of my instagram @laurenabarbe where I post my photogaphy and blog about fashion. I wanted to include a contact form for people to message me, and included a nice and simple about page for myself. I chose a simplistic design for my page to emphasize the minimalism I hold in my fashion sense. I feel like my page is a tad too simplistic at the moment and I hope to make it still simple but slightly more interesting.
